3. Create and start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Set permissions for the pgAdmin data directory:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 770 pgadmin-data
   ```

5. Access the PostgreSQL container:

   ```
   DB_HOST='localhost'
   DB_PORT='5432'
   DB_USERNAME='tournament_user'
   DB_PASSWORD='your_secure_password'
   DB_NAME='tournament_db'
   JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key"
   JWT_EXPIRATION="8h"
